# chainsyn

chainsyn (from 'chain synthesis') is a simple microplatform for genome
bioinformatics. It supports:
- Replication (DNA to DNA)
- Transcription (DNA to RNA)
- Translation (RNA to peptide)

Input/output of required data can be done via terminal or text file in FASTA
format.

Program can collect some statistics about available data:
- Number of nucleotides
- Number of codons
- GC-content %
- Peptide's mass
