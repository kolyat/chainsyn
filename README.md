# chainsyn

chainsyn is a simple program that imitates in simple way genetic processes in
eucariotic cell: replication, transcription, translation and reversed
transcription. Having list of nucleotides (or codons) program can replicate
another DNA chain, convert it to messenger RNA (mRNA) and then build
polypeptide chain.
Also, full virus cycle is supported: mRNA -> DNA -> DNA -> mRNA -> polypeptide.
